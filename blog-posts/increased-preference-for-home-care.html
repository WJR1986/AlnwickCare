        <h1>More People in the UK Prefer Care at Home</h1>
        <p class="text-muted">Published on [Insert Date Here]</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/blog/homecare1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3 float-lg-end ms-lg-4"
            alt="A person happily receiving care at home">

        <p>Attitudes towards receiving care have seen a significant shift in the UK since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a
            growing preference for care in the familiar surroundings of one's own home. A recent YouGov survey,
            commissioned by the Homecare Association, has shed light on this evolving perspective.</p>

        <h2>A Growing Preference for Home Care</h2>
        <p>The survey of over 2,600 adults revealed that <strong>more than a third (35%) of people are now more likely
                to choose care in their own home</strong>. This preference is even stronger among older adults, with
            <strong>38% of those aged 65 and over stating they would prefer to opt for home care</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Driven by Lifestyle and Choice</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, the survey indicated that the primary drivers behind this increased preference for home care
            are rooted in lifestyle and choice, rather than solely focusing on safety concerns. The top reasons cited by
            respondents included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Maintaining their desired lifestyle (64%)</strong></li>
            <li><strong> Having more control over their care (54%)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The ability to maintain relationships with family and friends (53%)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While safety was also a consideration for many (47%), the desire to live life on one's own terms and maintain
            connections with loved ones emerged as key motivators.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Homecare Workers</h2>
        <p>Jane Townson, CEO of the Homecare Association, highlighted the crucial role of homecare workers, stating that
            they have been "a lifeline for many people" throughout the pandemic, demonstrating "real selflessness and
            resilience" in providing invaluable support. She also emphasised that "homecare services can give people a
            wider sense of independence and control."</p>

        <p>The survey further supports this view, with a remarkable <strong>88% of people aged 65 and over agreeing that
                individuals would prefer to receive support at home rather than in a care home</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Recognition for a Skilled Workforce</h2>
        <p>The pandemic has also highlighted the skilled nature of care work. The survey revealed that <strong>over four
                out of five people (84%) agree that care is skilled work</strong> requiring standards, training, and
            qualifications. Additionally, <strong>89% of people aged 65 and over believe that care workers make a
                positive difference</strong> to the lives of those they support.</p>

        <h2>Celebrating Homecare</h2>
        <p>In recognition of the vital services provided by homecarers, the Homecare Association has partnered with The
            Care Worker’s Charity to launch a national ‘Celebrating Homecare’ day. This annual event aims to raise
            public awareness of the significant benefits of receiving care and support at home.</p>

        <h2>Home Care in Alnwick: Your Choice for Independence</h2>
